# Hostel_Management_System
The Hostel Management System is a role-based web application designed to streamline hostel operations and improve communication between administration, management, and students. The system supports two user roles:

Admin – Has full control over the platform. Can manage all users, oversee hostel operations, and assign or remove management staff.
Student – Can register, view room details, submit complaints or requests, and receive updates/notices.
Key features include:

Secure login and role-based dashboards
Room allotment and tracking
Student complaint/request system
Notice board for announcements
User management and data monitoring
The project aims to reduce manual paperwork, improve response time, and maintain transparency in hostel affairs.
